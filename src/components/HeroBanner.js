          Opperation Morraba was a secretly launched mission with one specific goal in mind: finding the safe house four fugitives are using to hide from the authorities. During the hunt your team didnâ€™t pick up many clues. But you managed to intercept weird coded digital signals and were able to establish informant-relationships in close range of the fugitives.
