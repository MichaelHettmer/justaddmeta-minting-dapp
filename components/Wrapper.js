          You were part of the mission from day one. During the hunt your team
          picked up different clues and also weird coded digital signals.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>After months of unsuccessful hunting the mission was called
          off. But you and a group of friends continued the hunt in secrecy.
          Last week the fugitives left a couple clues behind while strolling
          through the streets.<br></br>

          In a crate you find 50 jars of jam in three different kinds as well as
          two pieces of paper. Upon inspection you canâ€™t understand the writing
          but identify the other document to be some kind of map. You keep an
          extra careful eye on the jam as you see something swimming inside the
          jar.
